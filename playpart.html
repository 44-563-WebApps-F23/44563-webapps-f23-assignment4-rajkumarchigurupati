        <p>MRS LINDE.
            _[looking at her watch]_. Not yet—and the time is nearly up. If only he
            does not—. _[Listens again.]_ Ah, there he is. _[Goes into the hall and
            opens the outer door carefully. Light footsteps are heard on the
            stairs. She whispers.]_ Come in. There is no one here.
            
            KROGSTAD.
            _[in the doorway]_. I found a note from you at home. What does this
            mean?
            
            MRS LINDE.
            It is absolutely necessary that I should have a talk with you.
            
            KROGSTAD.
            Really? And is it absolutely necessary that it should be here?
            
            MRS LINDE.
            It is impossible where I live; there is no private entrance to my
            rooms. Come in; we are quite alone. The maid is asleep, and the Helmers
            are at the dance upstairs.
            
            KROGSTAD.
            _[coming into the room]_. Are the Helmers really at a dance tonight?
            
            MRS LINDE.
            Yes, why not?
